This is the `readme.md`file for the repository `lt2326-h21-a1` which contain my code for Assignment 1, (course) LT2326, autumn 2021. The repository contains the following files:

*    `lt2326-h21-a1.ipynb` (this is the file which implements the solution for Assignment 1)
*    `lt2326-h21-a1-OBSOLETE.ipynb` (an obsolete version, *please ignore*)
*    `utils_DimensionTransformationsCNNs.ipynb` (contains code for finding transformations of dimennsions in CNNs; *can be ignored*)
*    BEST MODEL
